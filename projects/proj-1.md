Photography technology companies have a history of looking at their products from one point of view and creating their “default” setting as fitting for white faces, as far back as 1959 with Kodak (Benjamin, 104).  Today, this history of centering white faces when developing technology around images has resulted in facial recognition technologies that can outright perpetuate racial biases, make mistakes when used by or for people with darker skin color, and ultimately affect people’s lives in major ways when utilized institutionally.  Looking back at the way photo technology has seen - or not seen - human beings gives us an insight to how the mistakes made in modern photo technologies can continue. As Benjamin says in her book section “Exposing Whiteness”, “You might be thinking, surely this is no longer an issue” (108).  For white people, the idea that photo settings have not worked for some people in the past might be completely new information, because they have always been served - their skin color has always been centered.  Ruha Benjamin elaborates on the idea that when someone or something is centered, someone or something else is being decentered.  White people, whose skin color has always been “centered” throughout history, must actively expose themselves to their own privilege, which includes understanding who and what has been decentered, even in ways that can seem more trivial– like the settings on a camera – because they have real consequences.
