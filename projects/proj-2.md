title: 'Small Complaints to Apartheid'
---

What might seem at first like a small complaint - “My camera exposure settings make it difficult to photograph my face” - is only one aspect of many related issues in the history of photo technology and race.  For a white person to write off even the small aspect of being able to take a good photograph is unfair when they fit the “default” settings for every technology that exists.  “Can the camera be racist?” an article in The Guardian asks.  What we know for a fact is that technology can do what it is told to do; in the case of early cameras, the technology was told to take photos of white skin, and white skin only. No one told the technology to take photos of black skin. But it wasn’t that they didn’t find a way when they needed to keep black people down, as shown by the use of Polaroid cameras with “boost” flash buttons to take photos of black people during the South Africa apartheid for use as passbooks, a way to track black people and maintain segregation (The Guardian).  In fact, the precise technology of this button made an artist hypothesize about its intentional racist purpose: “"Black skin absorbs 42% more light. The button boosts the flash exactly 42%," Broomberg explained. "It makes me believe it was designed for this purpose” (The Guardian).  Therefore Polariod, the company out of United Kingdom, was intricately involved in the South African apartheid until they pulled out around 1977 after protests.  Their images were essential to Pass laws, which were used to keep black people outside of the urban white areas and severely limited their movements (Benjamin, 106).
